# Handling RPC Errors in Blockchain Applications

This document explains common RPC errors when interacting with Ethereum nodes and how to handle them properly.

## Common Error: "input does not match format" with eth_getLogs

When you see an error like this:

```
Console InternalRpcError: An internal error was received.

URL: https://eth.merkle.io
Request body: {"method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{"address":"0x4BbeEa57578E4a078CB8ae4F98C83E45613868D2","topics":["0x64e67454795640f66cef8019a707b9381952f2f1024a355d5470bafc82af1800"],"fromBlock":"0x0","toBlock":"latest"}]}

Details: input does not match format
```

### What Causes This Error?

This error typically occurs due to:

1. **Block range too large**: Many Ethereum nodes limit how far back you can query logs
2. **Rate limiting**: RPC providers often limit requests, especially for free tiers
3. **Format issues**: Incorrect parameter formatting in the request
4. **Node limitations**: Some nodes don't support querying from the genesis block

### Best Practices for Event Log Queries

To avoid these errors:

1. **Limit block range**: Instead of querying from block 0, use a more recent starting block:

```typescript
// Get current block number
const blockNumber = await publicClient.getBlockNumber();
// Query only the most recent blocks (e.g., last 100,000 blocks)
const startBlock = blockNumber > 100000n ? blockNumber - 100000n : 0n;

const events = await publicClient.getContractEvents({
  address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  abi: contractAbi,
  eventName: 'YourEvent',
  fromBlock: startBlock, // More limited block range
  toBlock: 'latest'
});
```

2. **Implement pagination**: For historical data, paginate requests:

```typescript
const BLOCK_CHUNK_SIZE = 10000n;
let allEvents = [];

// Start from a recent block and work backwards
const latestBlock = await publicClient.getBlockNumber();
let fromBlock = latestBlock - 100000n;
let toBlock = latestBlock;

while (fromBlock >= 0n) {
  const events = await publicClient.getContractEvents({
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi: contractAbi,
    eventName: 'YourEvent',
    fromBlock,
    toBlock
  });
  
  allEvents = [...allEvents, ...events];
  
  // Move to previous chunk
  toBlock = fromBlock - 1n;
  fromBlock = fromBlock > BLOCK_CHUNK_SIZE ? fromBlock - BLOCK_CHUNK_SIZE : 0n;
  
  // Optional: break after finding what you need
  if (allEvents.length > 0) break;
}
```

3. **Implement fallback strategies**: Try different block ranges if the first attempt fails:

```typescript
try {
  // Try with larger range first
  const events = await publicClient.getContractEvents({
    // ...params with larger block range
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("First attempt failed:", error);
  
  // Fall back to smaller range
  try {
    const events = await publicClient.getContractEvents({
      // ...params with smaller block range
    });
  } catch (fallbackError) {
    console.error("Fallback attempt failed:", fallbackError);
  }
}
```

4. **Use dedicated indexing services**: For production applications, consider using:
   - The Graph Protocol
   - Alchemy Transfers API
   - Moralis API
   - Covalent API

These services index blockchain events and provide more reliable and efficient querying.

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Event caching**: Store events in your application's database after they occur
2. **Subgraphs**: Create a dedicated subgraph for your contract
3. **Recent events only**: Only show recent events to users unless they explicitly request historical data

By implementing these strategies, you can make your dApp more robust against RPC limitations and provide a better user experience.
